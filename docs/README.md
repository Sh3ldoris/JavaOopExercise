# Coding Challenge
In this stage you have to show practical skills in areas:

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Refactoring
- Automated Testing (Unit & Integration Tests)

### Exercise: Word Count Kata

The requirements of the Word Count Kata are located in [requirements](requirements).
You will find all requirements split into 9 iterations.
The goal of this exercise is __not__ to finish as many iterations as possible.
We will evaluate your solution based on __quality over quantity__.

Please focus on code quality by applying

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Refactoring
- Automated Testing (Unit & Integration Tests)

Please always look only at one iteration at a time.
The goal is to come up with a design which makes future changes to your code base as easy as possible.
Of course, you shouldn't over-engineer your solution but only design as much as needed.
This is exactly what we are going to evaluate.

### Assumptions

In case the requirements are ambiguous, please write down your assumptions into the project's `docs/assumptions.md`
file.
Please always create a section for each iteration and put your assumptions under this section.

### Requirements

Please use Java 21 or Kotlin as a programming language, the project is already setup to support both.
No Frameworks are allowed for this exercise.
No other libraries than JUnit and the Kotlin Standard Library must be used.
The project is set up to be used with Maven and Gradle using their respective wrappers.
Currently, JUnit 5 as well as Kotlin are configured in the `pom.xml` as well as in the `build.gradle.kts`.
We donâ€™t allow any mocking library.
In case you see the need for mocking, please hand-roll your mocks.
